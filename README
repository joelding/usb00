History

2017/11/29 p007 use interrupt for PDIUSBD12

2017/11/29 p006 use polling for PDIUSBD12

2017/05/17 p005 add PDIUSBD12 chip, but not really use it

2017/05/14 p004 add key

2017/05/10 p003 modulize codes. note: "If you have multiple source files in 
  your project, interrupt service routines can be present in any of them, but 
  a prototype of the isr MUST be present or included in the file that contains 
  the function main.

2017/05/07 I wrote this: I enpowered Averemdia and other colleagues too
  much. I need to take it back! (the authority to manage my target, my
  learning process ...) This is way too painful. I MUST WRITE IT DOWN SO
  THAT I CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE THIS EXPERIENCE CLEARLY.

2017/05/06 move to a new branch and restart again

2017/03/09 p002
  Learn how to implement printf.

2017/03/01 p001
  Learn how to write timer0 interrupt in sdcc. This program blinks LEDs connected to port 2 every 1 second. 

2017/03/01 p000 
To prove sdcc can replace KEIL. The program lightens up all LEDs connected to port 2.

2016/10/26 suspend due to working on 8148

2016/04/12 out of CRD, start working for SAV under Eric. Target of that time 
was to learn USB UVC/UAC, and MIDI by the way, as well as Windows/Linux/iOS 
kernel, and application programming.
